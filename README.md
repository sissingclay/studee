## These are my observation from the design

-   The header doesnt have a logo and company name
-   No shadow on mobile header bar
-   No back link on mobile layout
-   Back link is missed aligned on D
    desktop layout
-   Smaller spacing between title and first input, first and second input, and between Google and Facebook button on mobile design compared to desktop.
-   Larger spacing between sign in button and "or" on desktop. Larger spacing between Facebook button and "Dont have an account?..." on desktop.
-   Sign in button is not full width on desktop
-   Inputs background colour is to light as it on a light background colour. This will cause accessibility issues
-   Sign Up link at the bottom of the form is to dark, as the text is black. It might need a underline to be more accessible.
-   The right-hand section is hidden on mobile device. This is not required as the form is above it and it takes away from the user experience.
-   Forgot password is not align the same as on the desktop and mobile layout.
-   Or is not aligned the same on desktop and mobile layout.
-   Sign in to your account is not aligned the same on desktop and mobile
-   Background and foreground colours do not have sufficient contrast radio
